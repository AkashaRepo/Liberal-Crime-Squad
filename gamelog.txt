A NEW CONSERVATIVE ERA
The Year is 2009.
Conservative President Brad Tyler ends his second term with approval
ratings in the high 70s, and is succeeded by hardcore Arch-Conservative
Peter Burr.

With Conservatives sweeping into power in the House of Representatives
and Senate, and a Conservative majority in the Supreme Court of the
United States, commentators are hailing it as the beginning of a new
Conservative era.

President Peter Burr has asked the new Congress to move quickly
to rubber stamp his radical Arch-Conservative agenda. The left seems
powerless to stop this imminent trampling of Liberal Sanity and Justice.

In this dark time, the Liberal Crime Squad is born...

A NEW CONSERVATIVE ERA
The Year is 2009.
Conservative President Carl Heidnik ends his second term with approval
ratings in the high 70s, and is succeeded by hardcore Arch-Conservative
Nick Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

With Conservatives sweeping into power in the House of Representatives
and Senate, and a Conservative majority in the Supreme Court of the
United States, commentators are hailing it as the beginning of a new
Conservative era.

President Nick Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has asked the new Congress to move quickly
to rubber stamp his radical Arch-Conservative agenda. The left seems
powerless to stop this imminent trampling of Liberal Sanity and Justice.

In this dark time, the Liberal Crime Squad is born...
